## **why I used importlib.reload() here?**

If I modify the code in `mymodule.py` while my Python session is still running, the changes won't be reflected until I restart the session or reload the module.


Using `importlib.reload()` allows me to reload the module and see the changes without restarting the session.

## **Key Difference from .py Script**

* In .py → code is loaded fresh each time you run it.

* In .ipynb → kernel holds it in memory, so re-import won’t reflect changes unless you reload.

package_path = 'D:\fastAPI\Python_programming\Understand_Python_Package'
                           ^
SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 29-30: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape

1. **Problem Statement:** Path String Syntax Error (Critical)
The path defined using single backslashes in a Windows file path (D:\fastAPI\Python_programming\...) is incorrectly interpreted by Python. Python treats the backslash (\) as an escape character, which can corrupt the directory path, leading to the program failing to locate the intended package directory, resulting in a potential ImportError.

**Solution:** Correct Path String Formatting
The backslashes must be escaped using a second backslash (\\) or, preferably, the path should be defined using forward slashes (/), which work universally across operating systems.

```python
# Buggy path:
# package_path = 'D:\fastAPI\Python_programming\Understand_Python_Package' 

# Fix (using forward slashes):
package_path = 'D:/fastAPI/Python_programming/Understand_Python_Package'

```
